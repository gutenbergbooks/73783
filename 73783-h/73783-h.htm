<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br>
THE MIRACLE OF BOOKS.</h2>
</div>

<p>A book is a miracle wrought by human
agency. What more wonderful than that
the thought of a lifetime should be made
visible and concentrated so as to be
carried in the pocket; that black lines
and dots upon a white page should bring
before our minds the most beautiful
images. More remarkable than the telegraph
or the telephone, a book not only
annihilates space but time, and carries
the voice of David or Homer across the
seas of the ages.</p>

<p>The miracle of the widow’s cruse finds
its literal realization in a book. We
may take all we can from it but there
is just as much left for others with the
sole limitation that he gets the most
from books who has the most knowledge;
to him that hath is given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">(10)</span></p>

<p>No other property is so peculiarly our
own as our intellectual possessions. They
are always with us; no reversal of fortune
can deprive us of them. If we share our
knowledge with another we still have
it, and perhaps in a more orderly and
useful form as the result of contact with
a different mind, and the belief in the
immortality of the soul makes us sure
that our mental acquisitions are taken
with us beyond the grave. Education
and culture would be of small value
if they were to be terminated by the
expiration of a few short years of life.
Books are the only work of man that may
be said to be omniscient. They are the
stored-up memory of the race. As all
our experience of life would vanish without
memory, so all accurate knowledge of
mankind would evaporate without books
and we should have nothing to depend
upon but tradition.</p>

<p>Without books we should know nothing
of the workings of the mighty minds
of Homer, Virgil, Dante, Shakespeare
or Milton. Without them Caesar, Napoleon
and Washington would be traditions.
We can get but an imperfect idea of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">(11)</span>
history of our country except from books.
Books alone make books possible, and
nothing is more rare than a book which
does not depend for its material on other
books.</p>

<p>Books stereotype and petrify language
so that while the spoken word is volatile
and changeable we find in books the very
words in which we took delight years
ago. We may cause to pass through
our minds the same thoughts in absolutely
the same language that interested
Dr. Johnson or Milton; we may even follow
out the mental processes of Plato or
Aristotle, and see what they enjoyed
and note what they thought.</p>

<p>Books intensify thought; a book is
better than conversation in that it may
be brooded over, revised, extended, polished
and continued from time to time,
but it cannot answer questions except
those anticipated by its author. A writer
will put into a book thoughts that he
would not or could not express in conversation,
and through his books we may
know intimately a man who was known
only superficially by his most familiar
contemporaries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">(12)</span></p>

<p>Books not only acquaint us with the
thoughts of the great men of the past
but they enable us to make permanent
our own thoughts, so that if our ideas
are worthy of being perpetuated those
who live centuries hence may be as familiar
with our minds as we are with the minds
of Milton or Dante. A book enables
the thought of one man to reach all other
inquiring men in ages to come. Men
of whom their world was not worthy
have gained late recognition through their
books; men whose minds were far in
advance of their time have handed down
their thoughts in books which have at
last found appreciative readers.</p>

<p>The printing press has multiplied enormously
our means of giving currency to
ideas, but thought is no more powerful
now than in the time of Plato or Aristotle.
Men like these wrote books before the
time of Christ which are still consulted
on the subjects of which they treat.
Many of the problems of life and death
are as mysterious to us as they were to
them.</p>

<p>Better than any other relics the books
of a nation show what it really was.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">(13)</span>
The Dark Ages are called so because
few books were written in them, and Africa
is the Dark Continent because it has no
literature.</p>

<p>No other works of man have done
so much to spiritualize the race as books.
The Laocoon is not as inspiring a creation
as the <cite>Iliad</cite>, the Cologne Cathedral is
not as civilizing as Dante’s <cite>Divine Comedy</cite>,
and it has been said that the works of
Goethe have advanced the progress of
mankind more than all the conquests
of Napoleon. Books have more soul
than any other human work. A house
without books is as dark as a house without
windows.</p>

<p>Literature is the most enduring of
the fine arts. No painter, sculptor, or
architect has erected so permanent a
memorial as the poets have done. Statues
may be broken, pictures may fade or
be consumed by fire, even the pyramids
may crumble away, but the thought
contained in great books such as the
<cite>Iliad</cite> and the <cite>Aeneid</cite> is more nearly eternal
than marble or bronze. Lowell’s <cite>Commemoration
Ode</cite> forms a more durable
monument to Harvard’s dead heroes than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">(14)</span>
Memorial Hall. There have been other
actions as fine as the charge of the Light
Brigade, but it is only those that the
great poets have sung that are truly immortal
in our memories.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“For deeds doe die, however noblie donne,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And thoughts doe as themselves decay;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But wise words, taught in numbers for to runne,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Recorded by the Muses live for ay.”</div>
    <div class="right">—<i>Spenser.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Among the most lasting works of men
are mosaics; they are not easily broken,
their colors do not fade and their outlines
do not grow dim with time. In
the museum of the Capitol at Rome
is the famous mosaic of Pliny’s doves,
rendered familiar by so many copies:
three or four doves perched on a broad-brimmed
cup, absolutely as perfect in
form and tint as when Pliny saw them
two thousand years ago. Yet these tiny
bits of stone joined by cement are not as
permanent as the poems of Homer
which have as much human interest to-day
as they had when Alexander read them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">(15)</span>
in the intervals of his pursuit of the Persians.</p>

<p>The plays of Shakespeare will last as
long as the earth remains, and he said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Not marble, nor the gilded monuments</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The love of great books is in itself
a mark of greatness. Biography teaches
no more practical lesson than this; that
the world’s really noble men have spent
little time in reading any books but the
best, and that there has been a general
agreement among them as to what the
best books are. Socrates was familiar
with Homer and Aesop. Alexander slept
with Homer under his pillow. Montaigne
alludes constantly to the <cite>Bible</cite> and to
Cicero, Virgil, Horace, Seneca, Ovid and
other classical authors. Bacon makes
frequent quotations from the <cite>Bible</cite> and
also shows a knowledge of Aesop, Cicero,
Virgil, Ovid, Seneca, Montaigne and other
great writers. Emerson notes the fact
that Montaigne was in the libraries of
Shakespeare and of Ben Jonson. Emerson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">(16)</span>
read Chaucer, Montaigne, Plutarch
and Plato while at college and knew
Shakespeare almost by heart.</p>

<p>When we realize how few books the
men of antiquity had we understand
that they were <em>obliged</em> to read not many
things but much. Homer probably had
no books at all. Socrates had very few
and even Cicero, the accomplished scholar,
few in comparison with a modern library.
He never read Dante or Milton or Shakespeare.</p>

<p>The habit of communing with great
thoughts gives health and vigor to the
mind. Men who habitually read the classics
have a breadth of view and a toughness
of mental fibre which cannot be obtained
by those whose highest inspiration is
derived from the newspaper and the
last novel. Reading the best books gives
an elevation of thought which raises
above the level of common things, ennobles
and makes fine the ordinary daily
occupations, dignifies life and makes it
worth living. The woman who keeps
her <cite>Bible</cite> open while she is sewing and
refreshes herself with the <cite>Psalms</cite> or
the <cite>Gospels</cite> is deriving mental as well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">(17)</span>
as spiritual nourishment; without such
inspiration her labor would fade into the
light of common day.</p>

<p>We need great books to take us out
of ourselves, and to show us in true perspective
our relations to the past, the
present and the future. We may find
from books if we have not learned from
our own observation the true heroism
that is present in the pain and poverty
and distress of everyday life. “Books,”
said Emerson, “impart sympathetic activity
to the moral powers. Go with mean
people and you think life is mean. Then
read Plutarch, and the world is a proud
place, peopled with men of positive quality,
with heroes and demigods standing around
us, who will not let us sleep.” Michael
Angelo said “When I read Homer I look
to see if I am not twenty feet tall.”</p>

THE USE OF BOOKS.</h2>
</div>

<p>“He that shall make search after knowledge,
let him seek it where it is,” said
Montaigne of books.</p>

<p>Whatever your purpose, books will
help you to accomplish it. They make
the knowledge of mankind our own if
we know how to avail ourselves of them.
Only the wise can get the best out of
books, they refuse to deliver their message
to the ignorant.</p>

<p>Next to knowing a thing yourself the
most necessary thing is knowing where
to find it, and the method of getting at
the information which is stored in books
is an art that must be acquired.</p>

<p>It is an education to take up some subject
and master it, examining all the books
about it and weighing all the varying
and conflicting opinions. You never
realize the depth of human knowledge
and the difficulty of judging what the
truth is, until you have found out from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">(19)</span>
your own experience the infinite labor
of mastering one small division of one
subject.</p>

<p>From catalogues and bibliographies you
may make a list of the best works on the
subject that you are investigating and you
must then quarry from these books what
is of use to you and arrange it in a logical
and orderly way.</p>

<p>You need not read all the books; some
contain what you already know, and
in many of them there is repetition of
what you have seen elsewhere. You
glance through one and find little to the
purpose, the table of contents of another
shows that here and there is matter
that should be looked over, at last you
come to a work by a great man, a master
of the subject, every word of which must
be read and pondered on.</p>

<p>From these books you obtain references
to others that you did not know of; judgment
must be shown in concentrating
yourself on what is of real value, and
in not going out of your way to explore
alluring but useless by-paths. When you
take many notes in blank books it is difficult
to refer to them unless you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">(20)</span>
an index, the making and use of which
requires time, but notes taken on one
side of sheets of loose paper may easily
be sorted into large envelopes according
to the divisions of the subject, and as
your investigations proceed and your
knowledge widens new divisions may
readily be made. There is a decided
advantage in having all the notes of a
kind together and when they are on separate
pieces of paper they may be pasted
or pinned in strips and their order changed
at will. You may not have your note
book with you but a bit of blank paper
can always be obtained. These notes
may be a word or two here to remind
you of an idea, a quotation there, accurately
copied, and, most important of all,
such original thoughts as have occurred
to you. You will strengthen your mind
and also improve your diction, by writing
out fully the ideas that occur to you while
reading. When you do this, you will
not read so many books, but you will
derive infinitely more good from those
you do read. You will pay more attention
and will be careful that what you read
is worth noting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">(21)</span></p>

<p>Take notes freely and as much as possible
in your own language. “Writing
maketh an exact man.” According to
Dr. Watts, more is gained by writing out
once than by reading five times. What
you have taken notes of is thereby fixed
in your mind and when you have classified
your subject according to its natural
divisions you have, in so doing, formed
new associations which will help you to
remember it.</p>

<p>When your materials are collected and
arranged, your work is half done. What
remains requires a mental faculty of
a higher order:—the power of coördination.</p>

<p>Just here the difference appears between
a penny-a-liner and the author of a book
of permanent value. Both men may be
industrious, both may have good ideas,
but the author has a breadth of mind
which enables him to coördinate his knowledge;
he pursues a connected chain
of thought leading to definite conclusions,
he has assimilated what he has found in
books, reinforced it by his own observation
and study, and the result is a compact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">(22)</span>
and organic whole, a material addition
to the knowledge of the world.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Fable for Critics</cite>, Lowell thus
describes the unorderly worker among
books:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Twould be endless to tell you the things that he knew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All separate facts, undeniably true,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But with him or each other they’d nothing to do,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No power of combining, arranging, discerning,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Digested the masses he learned into learning.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Try to see clearly the important divisions
of a subject, to be fair minded, to draw
your own conclusions, to distinguish between
the probable and the improbable,
to recognize the good points in each side
of conflicting theories. Especially learn
to classify and arrange the ideas you get
from books and to unite them to what
you already know.</p>

<p>If you can enjoy the study of some
special subject connected with your occupation
and keep at it long enough
to make yourself master of it, you may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">(23)</span>
by so doing educate yourself. You should
not only study the actual operations, but
you should also familiarize yourself with
what has been written about them, and
should make an effort to record a permanent
advance made by your own exertions.</p>

<p>“Knowledge of books in a man of business,
is as a torch in the hands of one
who is willing and able to show those
who are bewildered the way which leads
to prosperity and welfare,” says the
<cite>Spectator</cite>. How much, for example, has
been lost in treasure and energy because
politicians who have not read history
and political economy, ignorantly persist
in methods that have failed ever since
the world began. “A prince without
letters,” said Ben Jonson, “is a pilot <span class="cor" title="Source: with out" id="cor23">without</span>
eyes. All his government is groping.”
“It is manifest that all government of
action is to be gotten by knowledge,
and knowledge, best, by gathering many
knowledges, which is reading,” wrote Sir
Philip Sidney.</p>

<p>When you read a number of books on
the same topic each throws light on the
other and you get deeper, clearer ideas.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">(24)</span>
You think more. One subject studied
thoroughly has more educational value
than many looked at superficially. But
while there is the greatest culture value in
taking up one line of thought and pursuing
it as far as possible, the importance
of the broad foundation to build on must
always be kept before you. “What science
and practical life alike need is not narrow
men, but broad men sharpened to a point,”
says Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler.</p>

<p>There is no occupation where a fund
of general information is not valuable,
provided it be accurate. The knowledge
of a little law is as useful to the doctor
as that of a little medicine is to the lawyer.</p>

<p>How much more useful a man is in
all branches of his calling if he knows
thoroughly at least one part of it. You
cannot do anything that will add more
to your value to yourself and to the world
in general than to study your occupation
all your life. If your work as a student
ends with school or college, your usefulness
will be limited and you will always
occupy a subordinate position.</p>

<p>Education is a life work, we have no
time to waste, but we should take time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">(25)</span>
enough to do it well. Be satisfied with
a slow advance if you are getting ahead
all the time, but do not be turned aside
from the track.</p>

<p>Do not make the mistake of supposing
that converse with the thoughts of men
as preserved in books can take the place
of communion with living men. You
will get warped and unreal ideas of life
if you do. Talk about what you read
with intellectual people. We are educated
by association with men, by pictures, by
music, by nature as well as by the study
of books. Commune with other men but
do not omit to commune with yourself,
only by so doing can you gain “that final
and higher product of knowledge which
we call wisdom.” “Read to weigh and
consider,” said Bacon, that means to think.
Wordsworth speaks of “knowledge purchased
with the loss of power,” and
Huxley says, “the great end of life is
not knowledge but action. What men
need is, as much knowledge as they can
assimilate and organize into a basis for
action; give them more and it may become
injurious.”</p>

CULTIVATING THE MEMORY.</h2>
</div>

<p>Most of us forget, as Andrew Lang
says, “with an ease and readiness only
to be acquired by practice,” and would
agree with Montaigne that “if I be a man
of some reading, yet I am a man of no
remembering.”</p>

<p>To recall what we read we must first
of all pay attention to it. Attention has
been styled the mother of memory. It
is naturally united to interest, we attend
best to what we care most about, but we
may watch over our minds and force
them to return when they wander and
attention may be made habitual by
repeated and vigorous efforts of the will.</p>

<p>“There must be continuity of work,”
says Thomas A. Edison, the inventor,
“when you set out to do a certain thing
never let anything disturb you from doing
that. This power of putting the thought
on one particular thing, and keeping it
there for hours at time, comes from practice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">(27)</span>
and it takes a long while to get in
the habit. I remember, a long while ago,
I could only think ten minutes on a given
subject before something else would come
to my mind. But after long practice
I can now keep my mind for hours on one
topic without being distracted with
<span class="cor" title="Source: thoughs" id="cor27">thoughts</span> of other matters.”</p>

<p>On the other hand those who find
difficulty in focusing the mind for long
periods of time may be comforted by
the following opinion of Professor William
James than whom there is no better
authority on matters of this kind: “The
total mental efficiency of a man is the
resultant of the working together of all
his faculties. He is too complex a being
for any one of them to have the casting
vote. If any one of them do have the
casting vote, it is more likely to be the
strength of his desire and passion, the
strength of the interest he takes in what
is proposed; concentration, memory, reasoning
power, inventiveness, excellence
of the senses,—all are subsidiary to this.
No matter how scatter-brained the type
of a man’s successive fields of consciousness
may be, if he really <em>care</em> for a subject,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">(28)</span>
he will return to it incessantly from his
incessant wanderings, and <span class="cor" title="Source: first," id="cor28">first</span> and last
do more with it, and get more result
from it, than another person whose attention
may be more continuous during
a given interval, but whose passion for
the subject is of a more languid and less
permanent sort.”</p>

<p>We must have a clear idea of what we
read if we wish to retain it. We cannot
remember perfectly what we do not understand.
We must think about what
we read, assimilate it and unite it to
the knowledge that we already possess.
Every time we go over it in our minds
we make the impression clearer.</p>

<p>Professor James lays special stress
on the aid to memory that is derived
by this association of ideas. “When
we wish to fix a new thing in either our
own mind or a pupil’s, our conscious
effort should not be so much to <em>impress</em>
and <em>retain</em> it as to connect it with something
else already there. The ‘secret of
a good memory’ is thus the secret of
forming diverse and multiple associations
with every fact we care to retain. But
this forming of associations with a fact—what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">(29)</span>
is it but thinking <em>about</em> the fact as
much as possible? Briefly, then, of two
men with the same outward experiences,
<i>the one who thinks over his experiences
most</i>, and weaves them into the most
systematic relations with each other, will
be the one with the best memory.”</p>

<p>When we read a number of books
on the same subject the memory is helped
by the association of ideas, and on the
other hand we have high authority for
the statement that the memory is weakened
by aimless reading. There is perhaps
no one pursuit in which so much precious
time is wasted, no one in which the energies
of mankind are expended to so little
purpose, as in such reading. “Nothing,
in truth,” says Dugald Stewart, “has
such a tendency to weaken not only the
powers of invention but the intellectual
powers in general, as a habit of extensive
and various reading without reflection.”</p>

<p>The habit of sharing the results of
reading is as useful to ourselves as it is
to others. The scholar of whom Chaucer
wrote “gladly wolde he lerne and gladly
teche,” probably had no difficulty in <span class="cor" title="Source: re membering" id="cor29">remembering</span>
what he read.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">(30)</span></p>

<p>The reproduction of what you have
read by conversation or by writing aids
the memory while strengthening the mind.</p>

<p>Faraday says, “I hold it as a great
point in self-education that the student
should be continually engaged in forming
exact ideas, and in expressing them clearly
by language.” Professor James remarks,
“a thing merely read or heard, and never
verbally reproduced, contracts the weakest
possible adhesion in the mind. Verbal
recitation or reproduction is thus a highly
important kind of <span class="cor" title="Source: re-active" id="cor30">reactive</span> behavior on
our impressions.”</p>

<p>Moreover, while cultivating the memory,
the reproduction of ideas from the works
of writers like Addison, Newman, and
Matthew Arnold is valuable in the formation
of a clear and simple style. It
was by careful reading of Addison and
by afterwards reproducing the thought
in his own language that Franklin when a
boy formed the habit of elegant and exact
expression that made whatever he wrote
interesting.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br>
WHAT TO READ AND THE ABUSE OF <span class="cor" title="Source: BOOKS" id="cor31">BOOKS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Many people live in first-class <span class="cor" title="Source: houses" id="cor31b">houses,</span>
stay at first-class hotels, travel in first-class
steamships and railway trains and
then read third or fourth-class books.
For them one book is about as good as
another.</p>

<p>If one does not care for the world’s
great books the fault is in him, not in
them, but he must realize the vastness
of human knowledge and understand
that some of the wisest voices of all time
have no message for him.</p>

<p>There are nomadic readers who read
as the gypsies live, camping everywhere
but for a night without purpose and without
profit. Such reading is mental dissipation.
Desultory reading jumps from
one book to another. You might as well
try to drink the sea as to read all books.
You must divide in order to conquer.
Do not read blindly, know what you are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">(32)</span>
about. Have a definite aim and purpose.
Do not read the first book that comes
to hand but when you hear of a book that
you ought to read make a note of it. By
keeping a list of books you may shape
your course and make your reading
a selection from a selection.</p>

<p>Do not prefer the new to the meritorious;
by following Emerson’s advice “read
no book until it has been out a year,”
you will avoid many loud-trumpeted
books. There is uncertainty in reading
a new book, but the value of the old
books is well known. We need make no
mistake.</p>

<p>Many of the oldest books are always
new but there are books which were
once standards on historical and technical
subjects that are now as out of date as
last year’s almanac. Be sure that what
you read is reliable and the best of its
kind. Prefer quality to quantity. Read
the great books for yourself and do not
be content with reading other people’s
impressions of them. Books about books
are seldom useful unless one has also
read the works of which they treat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">(33)</span></p>

<p>Let the books that you select be those
that have the approval of men competent
to judge, but bear in mind that the wisest
man cannot select the books that will
best suit others; each must choose for
himself. People are always glad to recommend
the books that have helped them
but they cannot tell whether such books
will help you. You must find out for
yourself, no one else can do it for you.
Do not be afraid to ask anyone who knows
more than you do. There is no information
which people are so ready to give as
about books, indeed when you ask them
they feel flattered. When Franklin wished
to make friends with a man that he
suspected of hostile sentiments he borrowed
a book of him and returned it
promptly.</p>

<p>To find out what the best books are
is no difficult matter, but to find out
what are the best books for us requires
a self-knowledge that takes life-long study.
In reading we must feel our way, we
cannot tell what is best for us all at once.
We need to get acquainted with our own
minds, to learn what our powers and
tastes are. This takes time and thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">(34)</span>
and, more than all, fair-mindedness in
order that we may not form too high or
too low an estimate of our abilities. “If
thou wouldst profit by thy reading, read
humbly, simply, honestly, and not desiring
to win a character for learning,”
said Thomas a Kempis.</p>

<p>Have a clear view of literature, know
what you like and why you like it. Be
honest with yourself, do not pretend
to like what you do not because other
people do. Do not be afraid to be ignorant
of many things, it is the price you must
pay for knowing a few things well. It
is only the stupid who pretend to know
what they do not. An educated man is
not ashamed to say that he does not know.
“The acknowledgment of ignorance,” said
Montaigne, “is one of the best and surest
testimonies of judgment that I can finde.”
To know when you do know a thing
and when you do not, is the first step
towards the attainment of sound scholarship,
and the next is to know where to
go for information. “Nothing is so prolific
as a little known well.”</p>

<p>To have a general idea of what is worth
reading and to know where to turn for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">(35)</span>
the books which are of vital importance
to one’s development must be the foundation
of any plan for culture. It is one
of the most useful results of a liberal
education that it gives a broad view
of the whole range of human thought,
and shows what to consider and what
to reject; it teaches to distinguish as
Lowell says between literature and printed
matter.</p>

<p>Follow the bent of your inclination
but make a clear distinction between
the reading that you do with a purpose
and that which you do for pleasure,
“what we read with inclination makes
a strong impression. What we read as
a task is of little use,” said Doctor Johnson,
and he added “if we read without inclination,
half the mind is employed in fixing
the attention, so there is but one half
to be employed on what we read.”</p>

<p>Much energy is wasted by conscientious
readers over classic books that are beyond
their capacity. Plato and Aristotle are
among the greatest thinkers that the
world has produced but their works
are not within the comprehension of
every mind. Indeed Emerson says that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">(36)</span>
“There are not in the world at any one
time more than a dozen persons who read
and understand Plato.”</p>

<p>Do not think that because a statement
is in print it is necessarily true. You will
often find conflicting statements in different
books on the same subject. “Some
books are lies frae end to end,” said
Burns. Fortunately this can be said
of few books but many contain inaccuracies,
mis-statements and exaggerations.
Weigh and consider all you read in the
light of your own experience. Books
like life of which they are expressions
and authors who produce them are of all
kinds, good and bad, uplifting and degrading,
true and false. We must value
them for what they are, not for what
they pretend to be, and, setting aside our
own preconceptions and prejudices, lay
our minds open to those who seriously
and sincerely hold other views than
ours.</p>

<p>The author tries to make us feel what
he feels and see what he sees. Some
can do this without effort on our part
and others like cuttle fish cover themselves
with clouds of their own obscurity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">(37)</span>
We soon learn from the way a writer
expresses himself whether he is accurate
or not and we depend upon those whom
we find careful in making their statements.</p>

<p>We get to love and trust authors as
we get to know our friends by long and
familiar converse. The writers we should
know best, with whose lives and complete
works we should make ourselves
familiar are those who have beauty of
character added to grace of expression.
Some men like Burns and Goldsmith
endear themselves to us in spite of pronounced
weaknesses.</p>

<p>Books give pleasure not only by what
they contain but also by the manner
in which it is expressed. Beauty of language
as well as of thought make the works
of Cardinal Newman and Matthew Arnold
attractive whether we agree with their
conclusions or not and whether the subjects
of which they treat are of interest
to us or not.</p>

<p>Milton tells us that we should have
a vigilant eye how books demean themselves.
There is in some ways more danger
from evil books than from evil companions.
Bad companions cannot be with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">(38)</span>
us always and bad books may be. Schopenhauer
<span class="cor" title="Source: calls," id="cor38">calls</span> “bad books, those exuberant
weeds of literature that choke the true
corn,” and even the gentle Charles Lamb
speaks with contempt of “things in books’
clothing.” The only use of poor books
is to teach us by comparison the value
of good ones. Rousseau thought that
“the abuse of reading is destructive to
knowledge. Imagining ourselves to know
everything we read, we conceive it unnecessary
to learn it by other means.”</p>

<p>“Literature is not shut up in books
nor art in galleries: both are taken in by
unconscious absorption through the finer
pores of mind and character in the atmosphere
of society,” said Lowell; and
Emerson wrote, “books are for the scholar’s
idle times: when he can read God directly,
the hour is too precious to be wasted
in other men’s transcripts of their <span class="cor" title="Source: readings" id="cor38b">readings.</span>
But when the intervals of darkness
come, as come they must,—when the
sun is hid and the stars withdraw their
shining,—we repair to the lamps which
were kindled by their ray, to guide our
steps to the East again, where the dawn
is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">(39)</span></p>

<p>“No man should consider so highly of
himself as to think he can receive but little
light from books, nor so meanly as to believe
he can discover nothing but what
is to be learned from them.” wrote Doctor
Johnson, and Professor Blackie says,
“all knowledge which comes from books
comes indirectly, by reflection, and by
echo; true knowledge grows from a living
root in the thinking soul; and whatever
it may appropriate from without, it takes
by living assimilation into a living organism,
not by mere borrowing.”</p>

THE ART OF READING.</h2>
</div>

<p>“The most important step toward getting
mental power is the acquisition of
a right method in work and a just standard
of attainment,” says President Elliot.
The secret of success in reading is concentration.
The mind must be focused
like a lens on just those books and just
those parts of them that are needed to
accomplish the desired object. Have a
definite purpose and do not allow yourself
to be turned aside from it. There are
those who read merely to get over a
certain number of pages and say that
they have read a book. Printed words
run before their eyes and make no impression
on their minds. In this age of
hurry many rush through books as trains
rush through tunnels.</p>

<p>The true reader makes his reading give
an account of itself. After you have read
a few pages stop and think it over and
arrange it in your mind. It takes time
to ripen, the best growth is slow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">(41)</span></p>

<p>We can no more become acquainted
with a book on a single reading than we
can know a man on a single meeting.
“Between reading and study there is
the same difference as between a guest
and a friend,” said St. Bernard. Ruskin
thought that reading the same thing over
and over again aided him greatly in
getting thoroughly to the bottom of matters;
and Dr. W. T. Harris has remarked,
“it is my experience with great world
poets that the first reading yields the
smallest harvest. Each succeeding reading
becomes more profitable in geometrical
ratio. At first, Dante’s <cite>Divine Comedy</cite>
was a dumb show written over with hard,
dogmatic inscriptions. It has become to
me the most eloquent exposition of human
freedom and divine grace.”</p>

<p>Bacon tells us that books are to be read
in different ways. Some are to be read
here and there, others to be skimmed
and a few to be studied. Be content with
gradual progress, the best growth is slow,
but keep constantly at it. Milton speaks
of “industrious and select reading,” and
that is the only kind that gives true
culture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">(42)</span></p>

<p>Says Walt Whitman, “the process of
reading is not a half sleep, but in the highest
sense, an exercise, a gymnastic struggle;
that the reader is to do something
for himself, must be on the alert, must
himself or herself construct indeed the
poem, argument, history, metaphysical
essay—the text furnishing the hints, the
clue, the start or framework.”</p>

<p>“Men give me some credit for genius.
All the genius I have lies in this: when
I have a subject in hand I study it profoundly;
day and night it is before me.
I explore it in all its bearings. My mind
becomes pervaded with it. Then the effort
which I make the people are pleased
to call the fruit of genius. It is the fruit
of labor and thought.”—<i>Daniel Webster.</i></p>

<p>We must recognize the fact that there
are many books of great value to others
that have no message for us. We may
waste time in reading good books that
we do not understand. <span class="cor" title="Source: ‘It" id="cor42">“It</span> is of paramount
importance,” says Schopenhauer,
“to acquire the art <em>not</em> to read.”</p>

<p>Books should be ladders to lift us to
a higher mental plane. No matter how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">(43)</span>
long or how industriously we read, we
can never be elevated by trash. The
more literature we ponder on and make
our own the better we are for it, but the
little thoughts of inferior men though
they may serve to occupy our minds
can never improve them. And on the
other hand the habit of associating with
the thoughts of noble men gives health
and robustness to the mind, which does
not grow unless it is exerted on something
worthy of its strength.</p>

<p>The books that help us most are those
which demand the exercise of our highest
powers, books which have a clear and
definite purpose and that appeal to the
best that is in us. Such books are not to
be understood all at once, but every time
we re-read them we get new light upon
them. We should not force ourselves
to read what we do not understand, but
should read the best that we can enjoy
and if that is not the best there is, it will
be in time if we persevere.</p>

<p>No other occupation is so well adapted
to the profitable employment of moments
of leisure as reading. At any place, at
any time, without preparation we may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">(44)</span>
read. Books are always ready to do
for us all that our mental state will admit.
No man was ever so wretched that he
could not claim and receive the <span class="cor" title="Source: companship" id="cor44">companionship</span>
and sympathy of the best thought
of the best men. No life is so cheerless
that it cannot be brightened by books.</p>

<p>Doctor Johnson thought that the most
miserable man is he who cannot read on
a rainy day. How much those miss
who have no love of reading, how time
must hang heavily on their hands in illness,
in bad weather, in the long evenings.
Emerson liked to read and study in a
tumultuous privacy of storm.</p>

<p>Reading is often the only pleasure of
the sick, bringing to their rooms the
heroes of all ages and the scenes of all
climes so that they may forget their
sufferings in sailing the ocean with Columbus,
or leaving the smoke and turmoil of
the city they may wander with Thoreau
in leafy nooks by the crystal waters of
Walden. Sitting in a poor room, ill-fed
and ragged a man may entertain Sir
Walter Scott or Lord Macaulay and
dismiss them without ceremony when he
tires of them. The fact that we can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">(45)</span>
stop the talk of a book at will is one of
the greatest advantages of reading. Lord
Macaulay might have bored one but his
books never do.</p>

<p>Reading is the great solace of old age
and is one of the few pleasures which
increases as the years go by.</p>

<p>Life should be a happy medium between
the practical and the ideal; those successful
men of business who have no
taste for literature often appreciate their
deficiencies quite as much as do the
impractical idealists who have never accomplished
anything of real value. Darwin
devoted his mental energies so entirely
to the consideration of facts, that
he lost all taste for imaginative literature
and deeply regretted that his mind in
this respect was warped and one sided.</p>

<p>There are, however, many men who
have become so dulled by the practicalities
of business that they consider it a
waste of time to read anything but the
newspapers or the reports of the stock
market. The pleasure to be gotten from
Shakespeare or Tennyson such persons
will never know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">(46)</span></p>

<p>Lack of time is made an excuse for
superficial accomplishment, but no one
is so busy that he cannot find time to
read if he will but diligently make the
most of his opportunities. “Dost thou
value life,” said Franklin, “then do not
waste time for that is the stuff life is
made of.” “In <span class="cor" title="Source: studies" id="cor46">studies,</span> whatsoever a
man commandeth upon himself, let him
set hours for it,” says Bacon, but, he
adds, “whatsoever is agreeable to his
nature, let him take no care for any
set hours, for his thoughts will fly to
it of themselves.”</p>

<p>A small fixed period devoted to study
every day is far better than a longer time
given occasionally. The result is not
only greater but the mental effect is
better. For by devoting a certain time
every day to the consideration of noble
thoughts your mind which grows by what
it feeds on is given food for reflection
so that it increases in power even when
you are not reading.</p>

<p>There are books not only for all sorts
and conditions of men but also for all
the varying circumstances of the life of
each and for all the different mental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">(47)</span>
phases through which they may pass.
A book may have a message for every
one but not the same message for each;
one it may encourage, another it may
rebuke; one it may lead further in the
path he is treading, another it may stop
and turn into a better way. Habits of
thought due to inheritance or occupation
modify and in some measure determine
the effect of a book and the nature of
its message for each reader.</p>

<p>You should adapt books to your mental
state, after a hard day’s work the mind
easily wearies, while with the strength
of the morning you may read the very
best that you are capable of. Read the
hardest book first and as your mind tires
lay it aside and take up something easier.
When you find that you are not appreciating
what you read stop and give your
mind a rest.</p>

<p>What we read depends upon our taste
and taste determines character and is
determined by character. Taste may be
cultivated and improved by always preferring
the higher to the lower when
we have an opportunity to make a choice,
by improving the surroundings and associations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">(48)</span>
by unconscious influence as
well as by conscious effort. There is
only one way in which a love for good
literature may be gained and that is by
reading good literature. People talk about
the English classics and at last almost
convince themselves that they are familiar
with them but how many do you know
who have really read Shakespeare?</p>

<p>There are constant allusions in literature
and in life to books with which everyone
is supposed to be acquainted, such as
the <cite>Bible</cite>, <cite>Homer</cite>, <cite>Shakespeare</cite>, <cite>Pilgrim’s
Progress</cite>, <cite>Scott</cite> and <cite>Longfellow</cite>. One cannot
always choose his business in life,
sometimes he is forced to do the first
thing that comes to hand, but he need not
engage in any recreation that he does
not choose and it is his own fault if his
pleasures are mean ones. We often meet
people whose minds seem flat and stale
because they derive their highest inspiration
from nothing more elevating
than the daily papers.</p>

<p>A common knowledge of a good book
may be at once the foundation of mutual
understanding and friendship. It establishes
a bond of sympathy between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">(49)</span>
minds cultivated and informed by contact
with noble thoughts. Such sympathy
is impossible for those whose minds
owing to lack of reading dwell ever in
the present amid material things.</p>

<p>Do not content yourself with reading
the observations of others; be an observer
yourself. Your reading should teach you
to observe, but some persons stultify
themselves so by constant reading that
they lose the power to perceive. Our
minds grow by exertion rather than by
passive reception. We are put in the
world not only to accomplish a certain
amount of work, but also to develop our
mental and spiritual powers to the fullest
extent; to make the most of ourselves.</p>

<p>By taking an interest in what is going
on around us we may add a new charm to
life. We are surrounded by the wonderful
and inspiring but only the great man
or woman has the sense to see it; for all
the rest life is hopelessly commonplace.
The man who finds the most to admire
gets the most enjoyment out of life.
The study of nature teaches us to appreciate
much that is beautiful in literature,
and, on the other hand, books help us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">(50)</span>
to enjoy many things about us that otherwise
we should not have noticed. Men
with finer faculties than ourselves have
observed and recorded for us beauties
that without their aid we should have
been unable to perceive. <span class="cor" title="Source: “Books,’" id="cor50">“Books,”</span> said
Dryden, “are spectacles to read nature.”</p>

<p>The power of a book to stimulate the
mind is one of its most useful <span class="cor" title="Source: qualities" id="cor50b">qualities.</span>
Some books are more valuable for what
they make us think than for what they
actually say. It is the reading that we
make the most of, whose substance incorporates
itself with our mental equipment,
that develops and enlarges our faculties.
What we read and assimilate becomes
part of the character. Rousseau’s <cite>Emile</cite>,
for instance, is one of the most suggestive
books ever written; Pestalozzi, Froebel,
Herbert Spencer and many other educational
thinkers have derived their inspiration
from Rousseau. Emerson is especially
valuable for the new trains of
thought which he suggests. Furthermore
a book is far from useless when it arouses
thoughtful dissent. Passages in the <cite>Emile</cite>
have furnished the texts for discussions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">(51)</span>
that have marked advances in educational
thought.</p>

<p>We form our characters from the men
and books that we associate with. We
cannot always choose our companions
but we can choose our books, and it is
our own fault if they are mean books.
A man may be known better by the
books he reads than by the company he
keeps, we should be quite as likely to
find a judge making a companion of a
pickpocket or gambler as to find a low-minded
man reading an essay by Lowell
or Emerson. Tell me what you read and
I will tell you what you are. It is what
we take an interest in that stamps us.</p>

<p>Matthew Arnold gives a concise definition
of culture when he says that it is
“to know the best that has been thought
and said in the world,” and he makes this
idea clearer by saying “culture is reading,
but reading with a purpose to guide it
and with system.” He elsewhere states,
“Culture is a study of the perfection
which consists in becoming something
rather than in having something, in an
inward condition of the mind and spirit,
not in an outward set of circumstances.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">(52)</span>
Self-activity is called by Sir William
Hamilton the primary principle of education.
By lovingly reading the best books
we may go on, year after year, giving
ourselves a fuller education than can be
gained in any university, because it is
life long;—eternity long. Such an education
requires time rather than money
and any one who has the determination
to improve himself, may like Sir William
Jones “with the fortune of a peasant
give himself the education of a prince.”</p>

<p>To read good books in a proper manner
adds to life a charm whose infinite variety
age cannot wither nor custom stale.
It was Huxley, the man of science who
said, “literature is the greatest of all
sources of refined pleasure and one of the
great uses of a liberal education is
to enable us to enjoy that pleasure.”
The gain is immense when we have learned
to like the things that are improving
rather than those that merely entertain.
The remark of Samuel Royce that whenever
intellectual pleasures are in the ascendant
civilization progresses, and whenever
sensual pleasures predominate civilization
is on the wane, is as true of the individual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">(53)</span>
as of the race. The nations which
have made an impression on history have
done so by intellectual vigor and not
by brute force. It is ideas not arms that
determine destinies and books are the
vehicle of ideas.</p>

CLASSIFICATION OF BOOKS.</h2>
</div>

<p>The multitude of books impresses on
us the shortness of human life, and immortality
never seems more desirable and
necessary than in the presence of a library.</p>

<p>The national library of France contains
about three million books and the British
Museum requires forty miles of shelves
to accommodate its two million volumes.
The room which contains the card catalogue
of the nine hundred thousand books
of the Boston Public Library is as large
as the entire space of many a village
library.</p>

<p>According to the purposes for which
they have been written books may be
divided broadly into three classes. In
the first place we have books intended
to convey information. This class is
very numerous as it includes histories,
biographies, travels, text books and works
on technical subjects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">(55)</span></p>

<p>The second class comprises those written
to amuse, and consists mainly of works
of fiction. This is also numerous, for
it constitutes the chief mental <span class="cor" title="Source: nourisment" id="cor55">nourishment</span>
of the greater number of readers. It is
estimated that novels form fully three-fourths
of the books issued by circulating
libraries.</p>

<p>The last class is composed of books
written to inspire, to which belong
works of the sacred writers and of the
great poets. Such books are comparatively
few in number, but they include much
of the noblest work of the noblest men
whom the world has known.</p>

<p>These three divisions are not separated
by hard and fast lines; Hawthorne’s <cite>Marble
Faun</cite>, for example, at once entertains,
informs and inspires, while, fortunately
for us all, the number of books that amuse
and at the same time instruct is sufficient
to supply pleasure and profit for the
longest life and the most varied tastes.</p>

<p>There is of course still another class
of books that are no books, works of this
kind far outnumber all the others put together,
and it requires constant care in
order to avoid them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">(56)</span></p>

<p>“Throw away none of your time,”
says Lord Chesterfield, “upon those trivial
futile books, published for the amusement
of idle and ignorant readers; such sort
of books swarm and buzz about one every
day; flop them away,—they have no
sting.”</p>

<p>Ruskin calls attention to the difference
between books written to render thought
permanent such as great poems and histories,
books of all time he calls them,
and books written merely for the hour,
the useful or pleasant talk of some person
you cannot otherwise converse with, such
as travels and novels which he says are
not books at all but merely letters or newspapers
in print.</p>

<p>“A book,” he says, “is essentially not
a talked thing, but a written thing; and
written, not with the view of mere communication,
but of permanence. The book
of talk is printed only because its author
cannot speak to thousands of people at
once; if he could, he would—the volume
is mere <em>multiplication</em> of his voice. You
cannot talk to your friend in India; if
you could, you would; you write instead;
that is mere <em>conveyance</em> of voice. But a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">(57)</span>
book is written, not to multiply the
voice merely, not to carry it merely, but
to preserve it. The author has something
to say which he perceives to be true and
useful, or helpfully beautiful. In the sum
of his life he finds this to be the thing,
or group of things, manifest to him:—this
is the piece of true knowledge, or
sight, which his share of sunshine and
earth has permitted him to seize. He
would fain set it down forever; engrave
it on rock, if he could; saying, ‘This is
the best of me; ... this I saw and knew;
this, if anything of mine, is worth your
memory.’ That is his ‘writing’; it is,
in his small human way, and with whatever
degree of true inspiration is in him,
his inscription, or scripture. That is a
‘Book’.”</p>

<p>DeQuincey has made a very famous
division of books, which I quote at length
because though often referred to, it is
seldom seen in its entirety. He says:
“There is the literature of knowledge and
there is the literature of power. The
function of the first is to <em>teach</em>; the function
of the second is to <em>move</em>. The first
is a rudder; the second, an oar or a sail.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">(58)</span>
The first speaks to the mere discursive
understanding; the second speaks, ultimately
it may happen, to the higher
understanding or reason, but always
through affections of pleasure and sympathy.</p>

<p>“Remotely, it may travel towards an
object seated in what Lord Bacon calls
<em>dry</em> light; but, proximately, it does and
must operate, else it ceases to be a literature
of <em>power</em>, on and through that <em>humid</em>
light which clothes itself in the mists and
glittering <em>iris</em> of human passions, desire
and genial emotions.</p>

<p>“Men have so little reflected on the
higher functions of literature, as to find
it a paradox if one should describe it as
a mean or subordinate purpose of books
to give information. But this is a paradox
only in the sense which makes it honorable
to be paradoxical. Whenever we talk
in ordinary language of seeking information,
or gaining knowledge, we understand
the words as connected with something
of absolute novelty. But it is the grandeur
of all truth, which <em>can</em> occupy a very
high place in human interests, that it
is never absolutely novel in the meanest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">(59)</span>
minds; it exists eternally by way of germ
or latent principle in the lowest as in the
highest, needing to be developed but never
planted. To be capable of transplantation
is the immediate criterion of a truth
that ranges on a lower scale. Besides
which, there is a rarer thing than truth,
namely, power, or deep sympathy with
truth. What is the effect, for instance,
upon society, of children? By the pity,
by the tenderness, and by the peculiar
modes of admiration, which connect <span class="cor" title="Source: them selves" id="cor59">themselves</span>
with the helplessness, with the
innocence, and with the simplicity of
children, not only are the primal affections
strengthened and continually renewed,
but the qualities which are dearest in the
sight of heaven—the frailty, for instance,
which appeals to forbearance, the innocence
which symbolizes the heavenly, and the
simplicity which is most alien from the
worldly, are kept up in perpetual remembrance,
and their ideals are continually
refreshed. A purpose of the same nature
is answered by the higher literature,
viz:—the literature of power.</p>

<p>“What do you learn from <cite>Paradise
Lost</cite>? Nothing at all. What do you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">(60)</span>
learn from a cookery-book? Something
new—something that you did not know
before, in every paragraph. But would
you therefore put the wretched cookery-book
on a higher level of estimation than
the divine poem? What you owe to Milton
is not any knowledge, of which a million
separate items are still but a million
of advancing steps on the same earthly
level; what you owe is <em>power</em>, that is
exercise and expansion to your own
latent capacity of sympathy with the infinite,
where every pulse and each separate
influx is a step upwards—a step ascending
as upon a Jacob’s ladder from earth to
mysterious altitudes above the earth.
<em>All</em> the steps of knowledge, from first to
last, carry you further on the same plane,
but could never raise you one foot above
your ancient level of earth: whereas the
very <em>first</em> step in power is a flight—is an
ascending movement into another element
where earth is forgotten.”</p>

<p>The verdict of time is never wrong.
Books that delighted generations of men
have done so because of real merit and
these are the books that have embodied
the life thought of great men. Shallow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">(61)</span>
books no matter how brilliant they may be
are short-lived. The best thoughts of
the best men endure in books that are
true to human experience irrespective
of the century in which they were written.
An author is great in proportion as he
perceives the universally true in life.</p>

<p>The books which do us good are the
sincere books, those which are true in
the highest sense of the word which
give noble and cheerful ideas of life, which
make us respect human nature, books
written by men who have a helpful message
for their fellow strugglers.</p>

<p>There are books which mark epochs
in the progress of the world just as the
discovery of America and the invention
of printing do, and the reading of a book
sometimes marks an epoch in life. Great
is the joy of meeting a real book by a
thoughtful man. Keats wrote on first
looking into Chapman’s Homer:—</p>

POETRY.</h2>
</div>

<p>Poetry is the flower of literature, the
most perfect utterance of the human mind
in no other of his works does man so nearly
approach the Divine, so that in every age
the poet has been regarded as the inspired
mouthpiece of God. The prophet was
the forth teller not merely the foreteller
and his message commanded attention
and respect as coming from a power above
the speaker. Whatever may be said to
the contrary there still remains the fact
that the greatest and noblest thoughts
which have ever occupied the mind of
man have found their highest and most
permanent expression in poetry, the outward
form of which differing from the
language of daily life is at once the accompaniment
and indication of the dignity
of a great idea.</p>

<p>Wordsworth calls poetry the breath
and finer spirit of all knowledge. To the
question, “What is a poet?” he replies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">(63)</span>
“He is a man speaking to men; a man,
it is true, endowed with more lively sensibility,
more enthusiasm and tenderness,
who has a greater knowledge of human
nature, and a more comprehensive Soul
than are supposed to be common among
<span class="cor" title="Source: mankind" id="cor63">mankind.</span> To these qualities he has added
a disposition to be affected more than other
men by absent things as if they were
present.”</p>

<p>Poetry is life crystalized into literature,
its value is in its eternal truth, in its universal
adaptation to the higher needs of our
nature. It is because we find in poetry
what we have observed but could not
formulate for ourselves that it impresses
us so deeply. George Eliot said of Wordsworth’s
poems, “I never before met with
so many of my own feelings expressed
just as I should like them.” “There is
some awe mixed with the joy of our
surprise,” wrote Emerson, “when this
poet, who lived in some past world, two
or three hundred years ago, says that
which lies close to my own Soul, that
which I also had well-nigh thought and
said.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">(64)</span></p>

<p>Lowell thought that the highest office
of a great poet is to show us how much
variety, freshness, and opportunity abides
<span class="cor" title="Source: n" id="cor64">in</span> the obvious and the familiar. Great
poets have concentrated in their works
the thought of an age. Gladstone says
that the poems of Homer constitute a
world of their own. “The study of him
is not a mere matter of literary criticism,
but is a full study of life in every one of
its departments.” Poetry has somewhat
the same relation to prose that a landscape
painted by Corot bears to a photograph
of the same scene. It is truth idealized.
The poets teach us to admire beauties in
nature that we have often looked at but
never perceived. If it were not for Scott
few people would know of Loch Katrine.</p>

<p>There is just as beautiful scenery elsewhere,
but we are waiting for the poets
to show it to us.</p>

<p>Sometimes the poets compress their
observations of life and of the working
of the spirit of man into words which
embody a great truth in a little space.
“Jewels five words long that on the
stretch’d forefinger of all Time sparkle
forever.” Often the poets produce an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">(65)</span>
impression or make a picture by the use
or a single appropriate word, as when
Tennyson says the cloud <em>smoulders</em> on
the cliff. He is master of the art of calling
up mental images by allusions to
color, sound and smell, and he carefully
chooses from his enormous vocabulary
the exact word to produce the desired
effect.</p>

<p>Lowell thought that the real literary
genius stored up the apt or pleasing word,
and Ruskin said, “he is the best poet
who can by the fewest words touch the
greatest number of secret chords of thought
in his reader’s own mind, and set them to
work in their own way.”</p>

<p>The inspiration and delight derived
from familiarity with the best poetry
is one of the most precious results of culture.
More than any other work of man
poetry helps us to cherish the ideal and
we look to our ideals to counteract the
hardness of our daily life, to strengthen
and uplift us. To read a great poet for
a few minutes every day raises one out
of the commonplace. Matthew Arnold,
who was one of the hardest worked men
of his time, used to read a hundred lines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">(66)</span>
or more of the <cite>Odyssey</cite> before he went to
bed. He said that “Good poetry does
undoubtedly tend to form the Soul and
character; it tends to beget a love of
beauty and of truth in alliance together;
it suggests however indirectly high and
noble principles of action, and it inspires
the emotions helpful in making principles
<span class="cor" title="Source: operative," id="cor66">operative,”</span> and he added, “We
have to turn to poetry to interpret life
for us, to console us, to sustain us.”</p>

<p>It is one of the fortunate miracles of
literature that so much of the very best
poetry is also within the comprehension of
the humblest understanding. Many of the
poems which have been the delight and
consolation of men of the greatest mental
capacities have also the power to encourage
and uplift those of far lower abilities.
The <cite>Psalms of David</cite>, for example, have
heights and depths which have made them
the inspiration of men of all classes in
all ages. Progress in the understanding
of the poets is the result of reading which,
beginning with those that are easiest to
comprehend, goes on with increasing power
to those, who, like Wordsworth, are philosophical
and deep and those, who, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">(67)</span>
<span class="cor" title="Source: Browning" id="cor67">Browning,</span> present particular difficulties the
overcoming of which is rewarded by a
vast wealth of inspiring thought.</p>

<p>Matthew Arnold, who speaks with authority
on these subjects says, “Constantly
in reading poetry a sense of the
best, the really excellent, and of the
strength and joy to be drawn from it,
should be present in our minds, and
should govern our estimate of what we
read.” and he remarks of the poet that,
“if he is a real classic, if his work belongs
to the class of the very best (for this is
the true and right meaning of the word,
<em>classic</em>, <em>classical</em>), then the great thing for
us is to feel and enjoy his work as deeply
as ever we can, and to appreciate the
wide difference between it and all work
which has not the same high <span class="cor" title="Source: character" id="cor67b">character.</span>
This is what is salutary, this is what is
formative, this is the great benefit to be
got from the study of poetry.”</p>

<p>It is not to be expected that at the
first reading you can see all the beauties
that a word-painter like Tennyson spent
years in elaborating. A masterpiece cannot
be read too carefully nor too often.
To appreciate a great picture like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">(68)</span>
Sistine Madonna, you must return to it
again and again and let its gracious sweetness
sink into your soul. It is so that you
must study a great poem.</p>

<p>Hence it follows naturally that there is
great culture value in storing the memory
with noble poems. While we should
not go so far as to say with Ruskin that
no poetry is worth reading which is not
worth learning by heart, there is an
inspiration in adorning our minds with
as much as we can learn accurately from
the great poets; and this inspiration is
derived especially from the poetry we
have known and loved in youth, which
has, from its very associations, a strength
and sweetness that no other can have.</p>

<p>“Many a noble poem,” says Henry
Pancoast, “early acquired by a pure
effort of the memory and at first but dimly
understood, has gradually worked its
way into the hidden depths of a child’s
conscious life, revealing its full power
and beauty only by slow degrees, and
elevating, quickening, and enlarging his
spirit in secrecy and in silence.”</p>

<p>Poetry as the truest expression of the
life and morals of an age is at once a prophecy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">(69)</span>
and a history. A prophecy as
indicating that to which the nation would
aspire—a history as a record of the fact
of past <span class="cor" title="Source: aspiration," id="cor69">aspiration.</span> Concrete individual
fact has little significance to poetry except
as the manifestation of an idea or of a
universal truth.—The poet is the embodiment
of his age and his era and a full understanding
of his poetry gives us an insight
into the very heart of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">(70)</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br>
BIOGRAPHY.</h2>
</div>

<p>Great poetry is the expression of the
spiritual life, not of the poet merely,
but of the poet in his capacity of forthteller
of what is divine and universal in
human life. History deals with the life
and actions and motives of men in a
particular age and treats of human achievements
and relations, and of their causes
and effects. Both Poetry and History
are in a sense impersonal, being concerned
not so much with individuals as such, as
with the ideals toward which or the ideas
with which men live their lives and do
their work. It is biography to which we
turn for the most intimate and detailed
personal knowledge of a particular great
man who may have been the poet whose
lines have met response in every heart
or the writer whose mind has guided a
nation. As dealing with life itself biography
may well be regarded as one of
the important divisions of literature. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">(71)</span>
may be and usually is found to belong
in both classes, the literature of knowledge,
and the literature of power. There is a
directness about a great biography that
causes us to feel personally acquainted
with the subject of it.</p>

<p>“The great man,” says Carlyle, “does
in good truth, belong to his own age—nay,
more so than any other man; being
properly the synopsis and epitome of
such age with its interests and influences;
but belongs likewise to all ages, otherwise
he is not great. What was transitory
in him passes away and an immortal
part remains, the significance of which
is in strict speech inexhaustible—as that
of every <em>real</em> object is. Aloft, conspicuous,
on his enduring basis, he stands there,
serene, unaltering; silently addresses to
every new generation a new lesson and
monition. Well is his life worth writing,
worth interpreting; and ever, in the new
dialect of new times, of rewriting and reinterpreting;”
and he adds, “as the highest
Gospel was a Biography, so is the
Life of every good man still an indubitable
Gospel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">(72)</span></p>

<p>There is an obvious similarity between
the biography of a great man by a great
man and the portrait of a great man by
a great artist. The National Portrait
Gallery in London makes real to us the
men who have been England’s glory in
peace and war. No one can leave it
after looking on the faces of Gladstone
and Tennyson and Sir John Franklin and
the hundreds of others who scorned delights
and lived laborious days without
having a higher estimate of humanity
and being nerved to new efforts, and we
may obtain the same effect in a more
detailed manner by reading the best
biographies.</p>

<p>The number of great men who are alive
at any one time is small, and they are
too much occupied to see any but those
who have important business with them,
but we may study them at our leisure
in their biographies, and go over the
events of years in a few hours.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the life of an author
always adds interest to the perusal of his
books and is frequently of value in explaining
them. The study of the noble life in
connection with the works of the noble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">(73)</span>
mind is one of the best foundations for
liberal culture. Consider the influence of
an acquaintance with the entire works of
Longfellow or Lowell, read in connection
with the life of the former by his brother,
or with the biography of the latter by Scudder.
To know the atmosphere which
surrounded such men, the things towards
which their interest went out, the sources
from which they drew their inspiration,
the way in which the common experiences
of life, so familiar to us all grew beautiful
under their poetic imagination; a familiarity
with all these things will elevate
a man’s whole life.</p>

<p>The light too which is thrown by biography
on the conduct of life is very great.
Theory, philosophizing, opinions, reasoning,
are of little worth when compared
with the actual facts of the life of a man
who has attained distinction in any department
of human achievement. Reading
of this kind teaches us that chance is
only to a small extent an element of success,
that nothing is attained by the brightest
minds without that infinite patience and
labor which in itself is genius. To think
of the brave way in which such men met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">(74)</span>
the trials that they were called upon to
endure is a most healthful remedy for
warped and selfish ideas of life.</p>

<p>Take the life of Scott by Lockhart;
note the domestic tastes of the author
of <cite>Waverly</cite>, his kindly interest in the
humblest persons around him, the heroic
way in which he nerved himself to meet
single-handed the overwhelming catastrophe
of the failure of Constable, the way
in which, while struggling with physical
weaknesses that would have rendered
another conscious only of his own sufferings,
he retained his simplicity and gentle
thoughtfulness for others,—all these lessons
may be learned from that noble
biography.</p>

<p>We should take a sympathetic interest
in the lives of high-minded men, and note
how in spite of obstacles and failures they
have accomplished their purposes and
how some have been great because they
nobly tried and in spite of the fact that
they nobly failed. Nothing is more helpful
than to see that our ills are not peculiar
to ourselves, but that others have overcome
the same difficulties that are perplexing
us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">(75)</span></p>

<p>Biography teaches us to look at life
from many points of view. In reading
biography, said Dr. Andrew Peabody, “I
find myself translating a life unlike what
mine can ever be into terms of my own
life, shaping from it analogies, equivalents,
and parallels for my own aims and endeavors,
studying modes of embodying its underlying
principles in forms, it may be of
which he whose experience suggests them
could never have dreamed.”</p>

<p>Learn to make a distinction between the
essential and fundamental characteristics
of a great man and such gossipy details
as what he had for breakfast and how he
wore his hair. “It is the great error of
thoughtless biographers,” says Ruskin,
<span class="cor" title="Source: to" id="cor75">“to</span> attribute to the accident which introduces
some new phase of character, all
the circumstances of character which gave
the accident importance.”</p>

<p>When a great man has written the story
of his own life the result is a book of
double value. Emerson and George Eliot
agreed in considering the <cite>Confessions of
Rousseau</cite> the most interesting book they
had ever read. <i>Franklin’s</i> <cite>Autobiography</cite>
is a model of keen and accurate observation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">(76)</span>
expressed in the clearest and simplest
language.</p>

<p><i>Boswell’s</i> <cite>Life of Johnson</cite> is commonly
considered the best biography in the
language. Of this and <i>Lockhart’s</i> <cite>Scott</cite>
Phillips Brooks says that they are “worthy
to be read and re-read, and read again
by all men who want to keep their manhood
healthy, broad and brave, and true.”</p>

HISTORY.</h2>
</div>

<p>The object of history is to tell us not
only what happened but the causes and
results of what happened, and this leads
the historian into almost every field of
human interest. He deals, to be sure,
with facts, as far as he is able to ascertain
them, but his generalizations and interpretations
of facts are an important part
of his work. The historian must abandon
prejudice, preconception and predilection
of every kind. He must deal with the
people, their ideas, development and social
movements as well as with the incidents
of war and foreign relations and the actions
and influence of great men whose
agency in shaping the progress of events
is often over-estimated.</p>

<p>As everything which passes through
the human mind is necessarily colored
more or less by the particular mind through
which it passes, we find that the history
of the same people during the same period<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">(78)</span>
will not seem in all respects to be identical
when presented by different historians.
Macaulay and Carlyle, each of whom wrote
history with extraordinary brilliancy,
present to us pictures of the times of
which they wrote that for interest are
wonderful but for accuracy are in many
respects less valuable than the histories
written by authors of less ability.</p>

<p>Psychologists tell us that the chief use
of the study of history is to train the judgment.
It has other uses, however, which
while not so essential from the viewpoint
of the psychologist, are important in their
bearing on the development of the individual.
The breadth of view which comes
from a knowledge of the relations of men
in another period or land helps us in the
understanding of the affairs of our own
nation or community in our own day.
Human struggles, achievements or even
failures must ever interest the thoughtful
man and the rise, progress and decline
or success of great movements in another
age enables us to judge intelligently of
similar or other movements going on about
us. Narrowness and bigotry will ever
exist even among men who are in intention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">(79)</span>
perfectly sincere and honest, but the man
who is narrow and bigoted in regard to
any subject because of ignorance of history
or unwillingness to ascertain the full
facts is dishonest to himself. History
is one of the most enlightening of studies
and its effect upon daily conduct if rightly
viewed may be such as to lead men to a
wider and fuller application of the Golden
Rule. In fact much of what the historian
is called upon to record has a direct relation
to the Golden Rule or rather to the
frequent failure of men to observe it.
To the devout mind the working of God
in history is clearly shown, and the downfall
of nations may be traced in many instances
to a decline in religious earnestness
and to a consequent lowering of moral
standards.</p>

<p>The thought that human history from
the beginning has been one continuous
and progressive whole without a break
or intermission of any kind is an idea for
the clear expression and emphasizing of
which we are greatly indebted to Thomas
Arnold. The histories of Greece and
Rome are our histories, for from them
has come the glorious heritage of thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">(80)</span>
and social organization which we have in
their literature and in Roman law. All
facts in history are in some way related,
though we often lose the connection
through ignorance of intervening facts
or events, or through lack of knowledge
of even whole centuries of human life
and struggle.</p>

<p>The <cite>Old Testament</cite> regarded as actual
human history is a series of documents
pulsating with the very life and heartbeats
of real men. It is no dry theology
or book apart from great movements of
mankind. It is the living record of one
part of our race. History interprets for
us the present and enables us to predict
the future. It shows that there are laws
which govern human relationships and
that a knowledge of these laws will enable
us to judge what is likely to come to pass.
A study of the method pursued by the
men who have written great histories
reveals to us the diligence of investigation,
the labor to secure accuracy, the care to
be impartial observers that must characterize
the writers of history as we now
understand it. An important part of
the work of a modern historian consists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">(81)</span>
in weighing and interpreting the statements
of writers of long ago who are often
the only source we have of information
concerning the things of which they wrote.
No source of information is to be ignored.
An inscription on a coin may unfold a
story to the patient searcher for historical
knowledge; an Etruscan tomb may
modify our understanding of a passage
of early Roman history; a visit to the
scene of one of Caesar’s battles may give
us an entirely different idea of the great
general’s account of it.</p>

<p>John Fiske said that “The real history
of a people includes everything about
them and is therefore an aggregate of innumerable
facts. It is impossible and undesirable
to present all these facts or a
millionth part of them and so history must
be a selection from infinite details. Historic
facts are not of equal value and the
historian fixes upon those only which he
thinks will help him show the greater features
of a people’s origin, rise, progress
and vicissitudes. It is desirable to have
at command the more important facts
of history, but the most precious thing
history has to offer may be missed by one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">(82)</span>
who is chiefly employed in memorizing
it. When history is viewed as an assemblage
of unrelated facts, conquering it
naturally takes the form of committing
it to memory. When it is looked upon
as a development—a chain of causes and
effects—it appeals more directly to the
reason and the understanding. Most of
history we must forget, but we should strive
to retain something of interest in reading
history, something of power in following
up a line of ordinary investigation, something
of a disposition to seek for the underlying
causes of events, something of
a grasp of the mightier tendencies and
movements of history that makes it a
teacher of the present out of the wealth
of its past.”</p>

<p>History as contained in the biographies
of representative men is both delightful
and profitable reading. Montaigne tells
us that “the only good histories are those
that are written by such as commanded
or were imploid themselves in weighty
affaires or that were partners in the conduct
of them, or that at least have had the
fortune to manage others of like qualitie.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">(83)</span></p>

<p>Our literature is especially rich in biographies
and autobiographies of men prominent
in American history, such as Washington,
Franklin and Lincoln, and in
personal memoirs such as those of Grant,
Sherman, Sheridan, Johnston and Longstreet.
The accounts of the Civil War
by the Northern and Southern commanders
form a valuable exercise of the judgment
for they show how honorable men may
look at a question from different points
of view. Such reading should teach self
reliance and confidence as well as modesty
and fairmindedness. One should first read
a short and reliable book, and, after he has
obtained a knowledge of the course of
events, expand it by reading longer works
and by making a comparison of authorities.
Study the history of our own country, but
do not forget that it cannot be perfectly
understood without studying that of other
countries and especially that of England.
Students of history consider that Roman
history unites the ancient world to the <span class="cor" title="Source: moern" id="cor83">modern</span>;
French history is the story of civilization
from the twelfth to the eighteenth
century, European history centres in
French history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">(84)</span></p>

<p>We may sometimes get an excellent
idea of history from a historical novel
such as <cite>The Virginians</cite> or <cite>The Scarlet
Letter</cite>, for such works give us a picture
of social conditions of the times with great
historical characters appearing usually,
if at all, in the background or setting of
the story.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br>
FICTION.</h2>
</div>

<p>Fiction which includes two closely
related forms, the novel or romance and
the drama, has two functions; the more
important being the interpreting and reflecting
of life, the holding of the mirror
up to nature, as Hamlet called it, and the
giving of pleasure as a result of the presentation.</p>

<p>The romance which may be in the form
of a novel or of a drama differs from the
ordinary novel as chiefly in dealing with
the unusual and improbable, including the
supernatural. The novel performs to-day a
great part of what the drama performed
practically alone in the days of Elizabeth
and James.</p>

<p>The close relation of the drama and the
novel is seen in the fact that the same
story may be told in both forms and it
is common to-day to see a successful novel
presented as a drama on the stage while
on the other hand, novels have sometimes
been written from plays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">(86)</span></p>

<p>The novel and the drama are classed
as fiction because they present pictures
that are usually not representations of
actual fact, but no novel or drama is worthy
of consideration which is untrue to what
might happen in human life or to the
great essential truths of human relationships.
This is not a distinction between
moral and immoral novels and dramas,
for an immoral book may be true to facts
in human experience, but they are the facts
of pathological conditions and not of
health.</p>

<p>An immoral book is one in which vice
is made attractive and evil is condoned and
unpunished. The Elizabethan drama never
made vice triumphant and the sinner
always was made to pay the just penalty
for his sin. The drama of the Restoration,
narrower in human interest than
that of the Elizabethans, differed from
the latter notably in the attitude towards
vice; sacred relationships were matters
of jest by the dissolute courtiers and
their followers and vice was objectionable
only when found out. When our ideas
of right and wrong are confused and our
conceptions of morality undermined by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">(87)</span>
book, it is to be avoided, for it can only do
us harm. No good book ever makes sin
respectable though it may of necessity
present scenes in which disreputable characters
appear; one of the greatest examples
of this is <cite>Vanity Fair</cite>.</p>

<p>Keener observers than we are, who saw
deeper into the inner workings of human
nature have described in novels the operations
and consequences of love, hate,
avarice, revenge and other emotions which
are always likely to move the heart.
It is therefore of the utmost importance
that when we read fiction we should read
none except that written by masters who
really did understand the soul of man,
for when we read books by inferior observers
we get warped and false ideas. In
giving impressions of life the novel possesses
a great advantage over biography,
because, out of respect for the memory
of the dead and the feelings of the living,
the tendency of biography is to omit
or to subdue harsh experiences, so that
books like the <cite>Confessions of Rousseau</cite>
which describe the deepest workings and
weaknesses of the heart of a real man
are exceedingly rare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">(88)</span></p>

<p>Treating of imaginary characters, the
novelist may describe what he actually
sees without fear of hurting the feelings
of anyone. The tendency of many novels
to conventionalize life and to express in
set phrases the tenderest emotions is
another reason why we should read no
fiction but that which is true to life. We
may occasionally be obliged to read for
information a book written by an inferior
author but there is no excuse for reading
any novels but those of the highest class.
We should question fiction sharply as
to its effect upon our natures; if it does
not have a wholesome and uplifting influence,
no amount of interest that it
<span class="cor" title="Source: posses" id="cor88">possesses</span> should entitle it to consideration.</p>

<p>When you read fiction read that written
by the masters, like Scott, Dickens, <span class="cor" title="Source: Thackery" id="cor88b">Thackeray</span>
and George Eliot. Read the great
novels that the judgment of the world has
pronounced of permanent value but do
not form one of the large class whose chief
inspiration is derived from the last new
novel. The new book that every one is
talking about will probably be forgotten
in six months but <cite>Ivanhoe</cite>, <cite>Henry Esmond</cite>,
<cite>David Copperfield</cite>, and <cite>Romola</cite> will last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">(89)</span>
as long as the English language. There
are some classic stories like <cite>Robinson
Crusoe</cite>, <cite>Gulliver’s Travels</cite> and <cite>The Arabian
Nights</cite> to which constant reference is
made and with which every educated
person is expected to be familiar.</p>

<p>To keep up with the flood of modern
fiction is impossible. There is a great
gain if we can find amusement in reading
books which inform as well as entertain.
Prefer fact to fiction. Few are indifferent
to the pathos of Dickens and Thackeray
but there is a chord touched in reading
of the actual heroism of brave men and
women which no imaginary character
can affect so strongly. When we read
poor DeLong’s record, in the midst of
that terrible Arctic winter on the Jeannette,
“for myself, I am doing all I can
to make myself trusted and respected,
and I think I succeed, I try to be gentle
but firm in correcting anything I see wrong,
and always calm and self-possessed.”
we are moved by a real human sympathy.
Yet it is one of the miracles of the masters
of fiction that they make their characters
so real to us. Lowell said he knew the
sound of Squire Weston’s voice; and for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">(90)</span>
many people Baker Street, London, is
more definite as a landmark as the residence
of the imaginary Sherlock Holmes than
of the real Mrs. Siddons.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br>
LIBRARIES AND THE CARE OF BOOKS.</h2>
</div>

<p>We do not get the most out of a book
unless we own it; we cannot take a personal
interest in borrowed books, and, although
it pleases Mr. Augustine Birrell to think
of the thousands of thumbs that have
turned over its pages with delight, it is
difficult really to know a library book
with its soiled pages, battered cover and
the date when it must be returned impending
like the Day of Judgment.</p>

<p>There is the same difference between a
book that you own and a library book
that there is between a home and a hotel;
the one is stamped with the individuality
of its owner, the other is common property.
It is pleasant to have a feeling of
proprietorship in the great men of the
past and to speak of <em>my</em> Homer or <em>my</em>
Shakespeare. How close it brings us to
a man when we possess a book with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">(92)</span>
autograph or book-plate in it, or which,
better still, he has read and marked. If
for instance, we owned Lowell’s <cite>Don
Quixote</cite> with the notes written on its
margin in repeated readings from which
he drew the material for his famous
address, what an inspiration it would be.</p>

<p>The books that you skim you may borrow.
<span class="cor" title="Source: if" id="cor92">If</span> you buy them they will take up
room on your shelves that may be more
profitably employed; but the books that
you wish to read again and again, to ponder
over and to study you must own.</p>

<p>You may have a library full of books,
but what you really are is determined
by that part of them which you have read
and laid to heart. Yet the unconscious
tuition of books has a real value, we learn
to love them by having them about us.
Merely to surround ourselves with great
books and with the portraits of those who
have written them has a refining influence
as constant as it is unnoticed. That the
essay of Emerson or the poem of Longfellow
is where you can lay your hand on
it, that the kindly faces of the writers
look down on you from the wall, associations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">(93)</span>
such as these sweeten and elevate
life.</p>

<p>Although there is a luxurious beauty
about an elegant edition that is not to be
lightly esteemed, there is a satisfaction
in knowing that we can derive as much
food for thought from a cheap Shakespeare
as from a first folio. The truest
book-lovers are those who love the thoughts
that the books contain. Complete editions
of standard authors are the best to
own. The print should be large and the
books easy to hold and to open. If edited
at all, the work should be done by a
competent scholar. <span class="cor" title="Source: If" id="cor93">It</span> takes a great deal
of editing to spoil a classic, but nowadays
there is too much editing, too much thinking
is done for us.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson thought that books that
you may carry to the fire and hold readily
in your hand are the most useful.</p>

<p>The <span class="cor" title="Source: durablity" id="cor93b">durability</span> of the letter as well as
the spirit of a book is nowadays too
often disregarded. Publishers recognize
how much a striking exterior has to do
with the sale of a book and pay more attention
to making it attractive than durable.
In former times men had more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">(94)</span>
respect for books. The vellum bound
volumes of three hundred years ago will
be in good condition long after the books
of to-day have come to pieces and been
thrown away.</p>

<p>If it be true that the degree of civilization
of a people may be measured by its
respect for its dead, it is no less true that
the refinement of a household may be estimated
by its care for its books. Some
men of letters, however, have been remarkable
for their ill-treatment of books.
The poet Young turned down the leaf
where there was a passage that interested
him, so that many of his books would
not shut. Voltaire noted his likes and
dislikes in books with little regard to
whether they belonged to him or not,
while Coleridge said you might as well
turn a bear into a tulip garden as let Wordsworth
loose in your library; and in his
<cite>Literary Reminiscences</cite> DeQuincey records
a story which makes every book-lover
shudder, that Wordsworth cut pages of
Burke with a knife that had been used to
butter toast.</p>

<p>Mr. Spofford gives some admirable
directions for the care of books. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">(95)</span>
should never draw books out from the shelf
by their head-bands, or by pulling at the
binding, but by placing the finger firmly
on the top of the book, next to the binding
and pressing down while drawing out the
volume. Do not wedge books tightly together;
do not pile them on top of each
other; do not lay open books down upon
their faces, or place weights upon open
books. Books should be kept dry, but
not too warm; if moist they mildew, if too
warm they warp. No sensible person
would press plants in any book of value.
Do not mark the place by cards or letters.
It weakens the binding. Use thin paper.
Do not touch the engravings in books.
Remember that even clean hands may
soil dusty books. Those who follow the
injunction of the <cite>Prayer Book</cite> to read and
mark should be sure that they do so in
their own books only. The suggestion
not to wet the fingers in turning the leaf
would seem needless did not observation
show that there are persons with whom
this clownish custom still obtains.</p>

<p>A private library should be a growth.
It marks the stages of progress of the
mind of its owner; no other property that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">(96)</span>
a man leaves behind him shows what he
really was so fully as his books.</p>

<p>There are few hobbies a man can adopt
from which as much enjoyment and instruction
may be derived as from the
gradual acquisition of a lot of books on
some subject of special interest. Emerson’s
advice “buy in the line of your genius”
is weighty and should be heeded. A man
of moderate means may gradually get
together a more complete collection on
his specialty than the richest man could
secure at short notice, and his satisfaction
in the growth of such a library can never
be experienced by the wealthy book
collector who employs others to do the
work for him. All that is needed is steady
attention to buying such books, as opportunity
presents itself. Many of the
rarest and most valuable works cannot
be procured on demand and must be bought
when found, or the chance of securing
them is gone, perhaps forever.</p>

<p>The gathering of such a collection may
be made an education in itself, and instead
of leaving his books to be scattered
at his death, as has been the fate of so
many libraries, a prudent man would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">(97)</span>
provide that they should be kept together
and given to a permanent library. Many
an institution would be glad to add
to a good private collection on a
particular subject its own books on the
subject and make a memorial alcove to
the donor which would prove a far more
sensible monument than a shaft in the
cemetery. Now that men have learned
to respect books public libraries are as
nearly immortal as any human institution
can be. A great library is the only human
institution that can take all knowledge
for its province. Such libraries are mines
from which knowledge may be quarried,
and where the ideas of the past may be
adapted to the needs of the present.</p>

<p>In a collection of books on the same
subject each adds value to the other.
Many libraries are an ill-assembled throng
as useless as the vast army of Darius.</p>

<p>There is such a thing as an embarrassment
of riches. If you have too many
books about you, you may be bewildered
so that you do not read to advantage.
“Successful work,” said Lowell, “is the
result of a due proportion between the
task and the instrument. Southey, whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">(98)</span>
literary industry was so remarkable within
the range of his own library, said ‘that
he never should have accomplished anything,
if his energies had been buried under
the vast stores of the British Museum.’”</p>

<p>As a workshop the public library may
supplement, but it can rarely take the
place of the private library. DeQuincey
said that for mere purposes of study your
own library is far preferable to the Bodleian
or the Vatican, and Emerson thought
that the best of the Harvard University
library was in his study at home. That
was the best for his own use, because when
a man is working in a special line of thought
he accumulates in time a collection of
books on that subject that is more complete
than any but the largest library can supply,
and he can work with more facility with
books that are familiar to him and ready
to his hand. Emerson’s books, however,
would have been of little use to a Civil
Engineer or to an American Historian,
while a public library must provide for
the needs of all students in whatever lines
of research. But Emerson was under
constant indebtedness to the Harvard
library, in fact, that noble collection of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">(99)</span>
books has played no small part in the
literary development of Boston as well as
of the great University. “The true University
of these days,” said Carlyle, “is a
collection of books, and all education is to
teach us how to read.”</p>

<p class="p4">Read in order that you may know more,
be more, do more: books will help you to
accomplish all these things and these
